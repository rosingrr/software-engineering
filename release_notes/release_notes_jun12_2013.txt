Release Notes 
June 12, 2013



Comments:

REMEMBER to checkin release notes for every release. I had to add one for this release.

Requirements Document:
1. Incomplete requirements document

Specification Document:
1. User stories are important!! Include/Update them. Stories should be simple and should reflect the "task-in-hand"

Next steps:
1. Clean up basic UI.
2. Write unit test cases for modules you have implemented so far (use user stories to identify test scenarios). 
3. Henceforth, Write unit test cases before you implement a module/scenario (specifically, for issues that you currently have)
4. Include comments in javadoc style to all java source files (This is mandatory!)
5. Include comments to .xml files. 
6. Create a database skeleton

Good job on basic UI. It is important that you work as a team. Research and work as A TEAM (pair). Each team member should contribute towards both coding and documentation.

Keep up the good work, so far
